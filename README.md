## Learn CMake

This is my attempt at going through the official CMake tutorial.

I am unsure of the official license of the tutorial so I won't attach a license to this repository
however you can still use this repository as a learning resource.

I likely won't update this repository to keep up with the latest CMake tutorial,
however I may add additional sections of my own if a new feature arrives that I wish to use.

If you have any improvements, please make a pull request.
